## What is this tool? <br>

This is a mass-autoscan-exploit of [CVE-2022-29464](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29464) based on the PoC wrote in python by a third part.<br>
The Py file is available and readable, see also the bash script that don't contain any encoded string.<br>
Massexploit will upload a shell and a reverse shell and print out the path to access it. Easy, Quick and Cool.<br>
I know that probably the code could be wrote better and saving some lines, but i did it when i was drunk and just to do something.<br>
So?<br>
Just run:<br>

```bash
./mass_exploit.sh
```
This command can setup your shodan and zoomeye tool, API included (if you want to skip the setup of tools or api, just press enter to skip.)<br>
Then it start search for vulnerable hosts based on the dorks (examples are provided in the file examples_dorks.txt).<br>
If you prefer, the manual mode is always available through the command below.<br>
The mass_exploit.sh output will be printed in the shell screen.<br>
