This is a mass-autoscan-exploit of CVE 2022-29464 based on the PoC wrote in python by a third part.<br>
The Py file is available and readable, see also the bash script that don't contain any encoded string.<br>
I know that probably the code could be wrote better and saving some lines, but i did it when i was drunk and just to do something.<br>
So?<br>
Just run:<br>

```bash
./mass_exploit.sh
```
This command can setup your shodan and zoomeye tool, API inclused.
Then it start search for vulnerable hosts based on the dorks (examples are provided in the file examples_dorks.txt).
